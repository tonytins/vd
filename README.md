# Virtual Dice (vd)

Virtual Dice is a simple command line application written in Rust that I wrote just for shits. As the name implies, it rolls a virtual dice by default, but you can roll within any standard dice range ``--roll <4,6,8,10,12,20>`` or custom range ``--custom <number>``. The difference between ``--roll`` and ``--custom`` is that the former will excepts a certain number.
